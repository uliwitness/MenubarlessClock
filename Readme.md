MenubarlessClock
================

A little clock in the upper right of your screen that shows the time
even when the menu bar is set to auto-hide, but hides when you need to
click in the area it occupies.


What is this for?
-----------------

I easily lose track of time when working on the computer. Menu bar hiding
is nice and gives more screen space, but I don't want to lose the clock.

I also want to know when something important happens, like the battery
being about to go out on me, but only when that happens. So that's what
decides what this app will do.

I don't want to make another Bartender or replicate the entire menu bar.
